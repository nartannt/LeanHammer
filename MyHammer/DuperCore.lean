/- **TODO** If `Duper.formulasToAutoLemmas` were modified to include identifier information for fVarIds from the local context (rather than just include identifier
   information to track facts explicitly passed in as terms), then we could use Zipperposition's unsat core to also minimize the set of lctx facts that are sent to Duper
   (potentially improving `hammer`'s performance on problems with very large local contexts). This behavior should maybe be added as an option (since even if it improves
   `hammer`'s performance on some problems, it will increase the size of the suggested Duper invocations on all problems), but I definitely think this is worth implementing. -/
